🏥 Healthcare Service Backend
=============================

This repository contains the backend service for the **Smart Healthcare Appointment & Records System**. It is a robust, secure, and scalable RESTful API built with **Java and the Spring Boot framework**. This service is responsible for all business logic, data persistence, and security operations.

🚀 Project Status (As of 8th October 2025)

🏛️ Architecture Overview
-------------------------
  ![Database Architecture Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankitdoi-coder/HealthCare-Backend/main/Requirements%20&%20Architecture/06_Architecture_workflow.png)

  
This backend follows a classic **3-tier architecture** to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the application maintainable and scalable.

*   **Controller Layer:** Exposes the REST API endpoints (@RestController). It handles incoming HTTP requests, validates them, and delegates business operations to the service layer.
    +
*   **Service Layer:** Contains the core business logic (@Service). It orchestrates data and operations by interacting with the repository layer.
    
*   **Repository/Data Access Layer:** Manages all database interactions using **Spring Data JPA** (@Repository). It abstracts away the boilerplate code for data persistence.

🔑 Security Implementation
--------------------------

Security is a core feature, implemented using **Spring Security** and **JWT**.

1.  **Authentication:** Users authenticate via a /auth/login endpoint with their credentials.
    
2.  **Token Generation:** Upon successful authentication, the server generates a signed JWT containing the user's roles and identity.
    
3.  **Authorization:** For subsequent requests to protected endpoints, the client must include the JWT in the Authorization: Bearer header.
    
4.  **Filter Chain:** A custom JwtAuthFilter intercepts every request, validates the token, and sets the user's security context, enabling role-based access control (@PreAuthorize) on controller methods.
    

📖 API Documentation
--------------------

Comprehensive and interactive API documentation is automatically generated using **SpringDoc OpenAPI**. Once the application is running, the Swagger UI is available at:

**Soon**

This UI allows you to view all available endpoints, see their request/response models, and execute API calls directly from your browser.

🗄️ Database Schema
-------------------

The database schema is designed to be normalized and efficient, capturing the essential relationships within the healthcare system.

| **JWT_SECRET**        | A long, random string used to sign JWTs.      | `a-very-long-and-secure-random-secret-key-123`              |
| **JWT_EXPIRATION_MS** | The expiration time for JWTs in milliseconds. | `86400000` (24 hours)                                       |
